# Swing Sunmap

An auto-updating Swing visualization of the sunlit portion of Earth, as a Clojure
learning exercise.  My very first Swing app!

Developed as a follow-on to the Clojurescript  websunmap  which shares the
exact logic of  `sunmap.clj`.


## Credits

The code in  `sunmap.clj`  is translated or freely paraphrased from Java code
in SkyviewCafe which carry the following notice:

## Usage

Can be run  (from dir containing  src/...):

    ```
    $ clojure -M -m sw-sm.core
    ```
or from wherever you have placed the uberjar:

    ```
    $ java -jar path-to-jar/sw-sm.jar
    ```

A visualization of sunlit portion of Earth will appear, initialized at the UTC
 when the app was opened; as the countdown reaches 0 the image will update,
 the countdown will reset; and so on, continuing until the app is exited.

### Bugs
None known.
